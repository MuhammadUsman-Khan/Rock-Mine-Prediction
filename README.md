# 🚀 Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification

This project is focused on building a **Machine learning model** that can classify sonar signals as either a rock 🪨 or a mine 💣. The goal is to support underwater object detection, which is especially important in submarine navigation and safety systems.

---

## 📝 Project Description:

Using **Logistic Regression**, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, the model learns to distinguish between sonar signal patterns reflected from rocks and mines. The dataset contains 208 instances with 60 numerical features each, representing the energy of sonar signals bounced back from underwater objects.

## 🛠 Technologies and Tools:

* 🐍 Python

* 📊 NumPy

* 🐼 Pandas

* 🤖 Scikit-learn

* 📝 Jupiter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset:

The model uses the Sonar dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. Each sample is labeled as R (Rock) or M (Mine). Data preprocessing includes label encoding and train-test splitting for model evaluation.

## 🔄 Workflow:

* 📥 Data loading and preprocessing

* 🧪 Train-test split

* 🏋️ Model training using **Logistic Regression**

* 📈 Model evaluation via accuracy

---

## ✅ Results:

The model achieved good accuracy in identifying sonar signal sources, showing **Logistic regression’s** effectiveness in binary classification.
